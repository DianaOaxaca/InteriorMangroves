title: "Interior Mangroves Exploration"
---

This section focuses on comparisons between mangrove systems sites across San Pedro River inland mangroves in order to answer the following:

-   How is the diversity and structure of the microbial community in inland mangroves.

-   Considering that the Fossil Lagoon, with less anthropogenic exposure, is in the upper part of the river and the Reforma Waterfalls and Miguelito Dike, with more urban exposure, are in the lower part of the river:

    How different are the upstream and downstream mangroves?

-   Who are the drivers of the differences we see between these systems?

-   Which actors are preserved along the river regardless of environmental differences?
